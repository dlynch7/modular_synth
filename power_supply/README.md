# Power supply
---
I will use a +/- 12 V bipolar power supply very similar to [this Eurorack power supply](https://aisynthesis.com/diy-eurorack-power-supply-build-guide/) and [this MFOS power supply](http://musicfromouterspace.com/analogsynth_new/WALLWARTSUPPLY/WALLWARTSUPPLY.php).

I will use a power distribution PCB like [this Eurorack one](https://aisynthesis.com/product/eurorack-power-distribution-kit/).
