## Inputs
* Cutoff frequency CV
* Resonance CV

## Outputs
* Lowpass out
* Bandpass out
* Highpass out

## User interface
* 3-position selector switch (to select between lowpass, bandpass, and highpass)
* 3 LEDs (to indicate which filter is selected)
* Cutoff modulation amount knob
* Resonance modulation amount knob

## How it works
* Maybe something like [this circuit](https://www.birthofasynth.com/Thomas_Henry/Pages/VCF-1.html)
